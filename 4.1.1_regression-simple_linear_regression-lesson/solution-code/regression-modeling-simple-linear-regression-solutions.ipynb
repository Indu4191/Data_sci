    "Depending on how long you've lived in a particular place and traveled to a location for work, you probably have a good understanding of commute times in your area. For example, you've traveled to work (or GA!) using some combination of the Metro, buses, trains, Ubers, taxis, carpools, walking, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**All humans naturally model the world around them.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, your observations about transportation have built up a mental dataset and a mental model that helps you predict what traffic will be like at various times and locations. You probably use this mental model to help plan your days, predict arrival times, and many other tasks.\n",
    "- As data scientists we attempt to make our understanding of relationships between different quantities more precise through using data and mathematical/statistical structures.\n",
    "- This process is called modeling.\n",
    "- Models are simplifications of reality that help us to better understand that which we observe.\n",
    "- In a data science setting, models generally consist of an independent variable (or output) of interest and one or more dependent variables (or inputs) believed to have an effect on the independent variable.\n",
    "- Linear regression is an extremely common and critically important modeling tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model-based inference\n",
