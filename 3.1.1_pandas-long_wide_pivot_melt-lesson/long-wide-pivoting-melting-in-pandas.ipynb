    "This lesson is all about data transformation using pandas. Data transformation is the reorganization of the rows and columns of your dataset into a different, potentially more useful shape and format. \n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of transforming your data are to have better access to relevant information and to make manipulations of that data more streamlined. As you become more familiar with datasets and operations on them you will grow an intuition and appreciation for when operating row-wise or column-wise on your data is preferable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different data formats are better for different tasks. This takes time and experience to learn, but serves as an introduction to common structures, transformation, and how to apply these transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Understand the differences between long and wide format data\n",
    "- Understand pivot tables\n",
    "- Practice transforming data between long and wide format\n",
    "- Practice creating pivot tables \n",
    "- Learn how to avoid common pitfalls and obstacles in data transformation with pandas\n"

    "\n",
    "Between \"wide\" and \"long\", wide format data is the more intuitive one. It is a common format for .csv type files. You have already viewed multiple datasets in wide format throughout this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wide format data is formatted so that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unique IDs, subjects, observations, etc. are represented as rows.\n",
    "- Distinct information categories (variables) are represented as columns. In other words, there is a column for every \"variable\" with its own unique values.\n",
    "- The format can often be a more compact matrix, particularly if no or little information is missing.\n",
    "- Is not as useful for SQL-style operations: it can make it much harder or even impossible to join tables together on a value.\n",
    "- Wide can be more useful in pandas when you need to preform operations on variables **across columns**. For example, multiplying columns together to create a new column.\n",
    "- It is the data format required for statistical modeling (with few exceptions)."
