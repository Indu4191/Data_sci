    "## Practice Data Format Transformations: \"Long\" vs. \"Wide\" Format\n",
    "\n",
    "_Authors: Kiefer Katovich (SF)_\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will practice going between long and wide formats in pandas, getting deeper into `melt`, `pivot_tables`, and the pitfalls of hierarchical indices than we covered in the lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that **long format** has:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Potentially multiple \"id\" (identification) columns.\n",
    "- Variable:value column pairs that match a variable key to a value (in the simple case, a single variable column and a single value column).\n",
    "- The \"variable\" column corresponds to the multiple variable columns in your wide format data. Now, instead of a column for each variable, you have a row for each variable:value pair, per id. \n",
    "- This is a standard format in SQL databases because it is appropriate for joining different tables together by keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "And **wide format:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are multiple ID _and_ value columns. In other words, there is a column for every \"variable\" with its own unique values.\n",
    "- The format has both the conceptual simplicity of a single column of values per variable and a more compact matrix.\n",
    "- Is not useful for SQL-style operations: it can make it much harder or even impossible to join tables together on a value.\n",
    "- Can be more useful in pandas when you need to preform operations on variables **across columns**. For example, multiplying columns together.\n",
    "- It is the most commonly the format that you will put the data in when you are ready to perform modeling (with some exceptions). When we get into modeling next week I will explain why.\n",
