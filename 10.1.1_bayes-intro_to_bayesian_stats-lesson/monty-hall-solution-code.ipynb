    "If you've ever heard of the \"Monty Hall Problem,\" it is a famous problem in statistics based on the game show \"Let's Make a Deal.\" (Monty Hall was the original host of this game show.) If you haven't heard of this game show, no worries.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of \"Let's Make a Deal,\" there are three doors labeled \"A,\" \"B,\" and \"C.\" You are the contestant and are informed that behind exactly one door, there is a new car. Behind the other two doors are goats. Obviously, your goal as the contestant is to select the door with the car.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game goes as follows:\n",
    "1. You select a door.\n",
    "2. The game show host, knowing which door hides the car, opens one of the doors you do not select to reveal a goat. (Important: If you selected a door with a goat, the host picks the other door with a goat. If you started by selecting the door with the car, the host picks from the remaining two doors at random.)\n",
    "3. The host then asks you if you would like to stick with the door you originally picked, or if you would want to switch to the other remaining door."

    "Suppose you pick a door. The host opens one of the remaining doors. You are then asked to stick with your original door or to switch to the remaining door. Based on your intuition, is it more advantageous to stick with your original door, to switch to the remaining door, or does your probability of success not change?"
